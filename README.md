# sql-challenge
Hi, welcome to my SQL query code.

I tried to make those files as easy as possible to read.
You can see the picture of my ERD and the .sql table schemata in the main repo.
You can see my queries in the "EmployeeSQL" folder under the file "better_sql_code.sql"

For the bonus part.
I did all the work and it run.
For security purpose I am not going to link my postgresql password.
In the jupyter notebook on line 3, you will have to input your own password to run the code - i think.
I am not quite sure how this works since i have never done this before. 


Employee ID 499942 has the name of: April Foolsday

Let me know if you have any problem.
